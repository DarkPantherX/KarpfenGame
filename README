We have managed to get some really nice code up and running.
Now the next problem is the clean up which we have to do, so the code doesn't get out of hand.
To contribut to this I invented a new system to bring some structure to out classes:

New Way of sturctoring class:


1. imports
2. class
3. public static variables
4. private static variables
5. public non-static variables
6. priavte non-static variables
7. Constuctor
8. update & paint-methodes
9. Functions which are typicall for this class (except main function)
10. getters and setters functions
(11.main function)


See the Level-class, I already applied the changes there


With this was we can get a clean sturctor.
The next point is the real clean up:

In the future, before commiting we both have rewatch our code and see what could be made more efficient
And if we pull, we have to rewatch the code the other person wrote to see if we can improof the code

If you also have some point just write it in here... this should be our guide!
