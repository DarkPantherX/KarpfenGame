---------------------------------Codeing guidlines---------------------------------
New Way of sturctoring class:

1. imports
2. class
3. public static variables
4. private static variables
5. public non-static variables
6. priavte non-static variables
7. Constuctor
8. update & paint-methodes
9. Functions which are typicall for this class (except main function)
(10.main function)
11. getters and setters functions

In the future, before commiting we both have rewatch our code and see what could be made more efficient
And if we pull, we have to rewatch the code the other person wrote to see if we can improve the code
Lines marked with a # in front may be deleted - but no others. Mark them with #, if you want to get rid of them.

#NEW QUESTIONS by SC 18.10-2013 03:53
#3) Should Drop fall through walls as they do right now.. or not?
#DPX:Maybe be platforms should get whiter and whiter? ;)
#BUT we have to change the mec, that the zombies get damage by seagulls
#SC: So they should collide with the walls. (?) And the zombies already get damaged by Drop's. 
#    (Not by Seagulls though.. would you like me to add this? 
#     It would however not be clear, wheter Seagulls should hurt Zombies or Zombies should hurt Seagulls)

#DPX:Sorry that was a little wrong: i meant the projectiles (aka the seagull-shit) should make the platform whiter...
#	I dont want the seagulls to fly deeper... 
#	What I want is, that the zombies DON'T get damaged by seagull projectiles...
# [IMPEMENTED by SC: 23.10.2013]

#5) Should the camera also follow a certain y-changement? I think that would add a nice effect. (Like xOffset, yOffset)
#DPX: no it should, or you wouldnt see the next one down...
#SC: HAHA. No it should.. Eeer.. ok.. (?)
#    And you still would see the next one(what) down..

#DPX: If you like this idea this much you can try it... But be aware, that we might change it back...

Prioritie: 1-5
1:(very important, in the next few days)
5:(ehh.. let's do this later on... Maybe never...)

TODO SC:
# -correct the wall setting algorithm, as some walls are to high/low [IMPLEMENTED by SC 23.10.2013]
 -all the variables that vary from level to level are static. they shouldn't be... (3)
 -Seagull fly a bit more naturally (4)
# -Projectiles should "kill" Items [IMPLEMENTED by SC 23.10.2013]
 -Fix Seagull spawning (2)
# -Fix hierarchy: e.g. Level.update() -> Entity.update -> Mob.update -> Seagull.update // Not neccessary after all
# -I think i made a coffee-bug.. I have to fix it! [IMPLEMENTED by SC 23.10.2013]
 -Variable FPS support (5)
 -implement own ideas (always)
 -Code clean up and commenting the whole code (always)
 -Camera y-movement (5)
 
TODO DPX:
 -Reformat all classes to fit the new made rules above (2)
 -Add Menu (1)
 -Add Soundsystem! (That's going to be hard this time...)(3)
 -Add Achievement-system (Because i like them...)(5)
 -Code clean up and commenting the whole code (1)
 
IDEAS:
 -Drops should make platforms more white
