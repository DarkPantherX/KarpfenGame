---------------------------------Codeing guidlines---------------------------------
New Way of sturctoring class:

1. imports
2. class
3. public static variables
4. private static variables
5. public non-static variables
6. priavte non-static variables
7. Constuctor
8. update & paint-methodes
9. Functions which are typicall for this class (except main function)
(10.main function)
11. getters and setters functions

In the future, before commiting we both have rewatch our code and see what could be made more efficient
And if we pull, we have to rewatch the code the other person wrote to see if we can improve the code
Lines marked with a # in front may be deleted - but no others. Mark them with #, if you want to get rid of them.
-----------------------------------------Questions---------------------------------------------
New questions 24.10.2013:

1.)DPX:WHY? WHY? WHY? SC; WHY?
		I had to bugfix the shit out of this game... please next time use the .clone() command for arrays, if you just
		do it like this this.newArray=oldArray; you'll make me cry, because you just make a new pointer for the SAME object....
		(See Player.java line 257 & 258, I fixed it now...)
ANSWER:
Thats my understanding of Pointers:
Pointer p1=new Pointer;
Pointer p2=new Pointer;
If you put:
p1=p2;
then both p1 and p2 show the same object. The object pointed by p1 has now no pointer any more, and such can not be reverenced. The data is lost.
So in "MY BUG" i just made newArray point on the object of oldArray. The content of newArray will be lost.
I see, that my code does not make sense.
But I don't know how this can result in a null-pointer-exception?


2.)DPX:Why would you wanna change the lvl Variables? Is it so important? And isn't it more Resource heavy afterwards?
ANSWER:
As far as i know is int lvl the number of the actual level, wich is of course crucial for the game to know where it is.
What do you mean by lvl Variables?


#3.)DPX:Next thing I'll do is add the menu, okay? What's you next patch?
#ANSWER:
#Do that.
#I dunno. Any suggestions?

 -all the variables that vary from level to level are static. they shouldn't be... (3)
# -Seagull fly a bit more naturally (4) [DONE BY SC 11.11.2013]
# -Fix Seagull spawning (2) [DONE BY SC 11.11.2013]
 -Variable FPS support (5)
 -implement own ideas (always)
 -Code clean up and commenting the whole code (always)
 -Camera y-movement (5)
 
TODO DPX:
 -Reformat all classes to fit the new made rules above (2)
 -Add Menu (1)
 -Add Soundsystem! (That's going to be hard this time...)(3)
 -Add Achievement-system (Because i like them...)(5)
 -Code clean up and commenting the whole code (1)
 
IDEAS:
