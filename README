---------------------------------Codeing guidlines---------------------------------
#We have managed to get some really nice code up and running.
#Now the next problem is the clean up which we have to do, so the code doesn't get out of hand.
#To contribute to this, I invented a new system to bring some structure to our classes:

New Way of sturctoring class:

1. imports
2. class
3. public static variables
4. private static variables
5. public non-static variables
6. priavte non-static variables
7. Constuctor
8. update & paint-methodes
9. Functions which are typicall for this class (except main function)
(10.main function)
11. getters and setters functions

In the future, before commiting we both have rewatch our code and see what could be made more efficient
And if we pull, we have to rewatch the code the other person wrote to see if we can improve the code
Lines marked with a # in front may be deleted - but no others. Mark them with #, if you want to get rid of them.

#NEW QUESTIONS by SC 15.10.2013 00:51
#- how many Skills did we have?
#DPX: dunno... let's just start and add them...
#- should Projectiles "kill" Items?
#DPX: Well, I like this idea, how ever, I let you have the decision ;)

NEW QUESTIONS by SC 18.10-2013 03:53
1) How should Seagulls shoot? a) just drop their Drop, b) aim at the player, c) drop the drop at a 45Â° angle.
2) How should Seagulls spawn? it doesn't make sense, to spawn them atop of walls, as they all fly out of the viewing field. 
3) Should Drop fall through walls as they do right now.. or not?
4) we have to introduce a new type of weapon, so that one can get rid of the seagulls.. or should they be kind of invulnerable?
5) Should the camera also follow a certain y-changement? I think that would add a nice effect. (Like xOffset, yOffset)

TODO SC:
 -implement physical jumping (with a parabolic jump courve or so XD)
# -implement seagull with it's projetile [DONE by SC: 18.10.2013]
 -correct the wall setting algorithm, as some walls are to high/low
 -all the variables that vary from level to level are static. they shouldn't be...
 -Seagull fly a bit more naturally
 -Projectiles should "kill" Items
 -implement own ideas
 
TODO DPX:
 -Reformat all classes to fit the new made rules above
 -Add Menu (if this is okay?) [Yes it is]
 -Add more support for more than one lvl
