---------------------------------Codeing guidlines---------------------------------
We have managed to get some really nice code up and running.
Now the next problem is the clean up which we have to do, so the code doesn't get out of hand.
To contribute to this, I invented a new system to bring some structure to our classes:

New Way of sturctoring class:


1. imports
2. class
3. public static variables
4. private static variables
5. public non-static variables
6. priavte non-static variables
7. Constuctor
8. update & paint-methodes
9. Functions which are typicall for this class (except main function)
(10.main function)
11. getters and setters functions


In the future, before commiting we both have rewatch our code and see what could be made more efficient
And if we pull, we have to rewatch the code the other person wrote to see if we can improof the code

NEW QUESTIONS by SC 15.10.2013 00:51
- how many Skills did we have?
DPX: dunno... let's just start and add them...
- should Projectiles "kill" Items?
DPX: Well, I like this idea, how ever, I let you have the decision ;)



#A new thing to do: if we have written something and you think you dont need those lines anymore,
#just make a '#' in front of the line. So e.g. if i take a look at the Readme again I'll look through the things 
#you dont need any more and if i also think, that this is done, than we delete it.

TODO SC:
 -implement physical jumping (with a parabolic jump courve or so XD)
 -implement seagull with it's projetile
 -correct the wall setting algorithm, as some walls are to high/low
 -all the variables that vary from level to level are static. they shouldn't be...
 -implement own ideas
 
TODO DPX:
 -Reformat all classes to fit the new made rules above
 -Add Menu (if this is okay?) [Yes it is]
 -Add more support for more than one lvl
