---------------------------------Codeing guidlines---------------------------------
New Way of sturctoring class:

1. imports
2. class
3. public static variables
4. private static variables
5. public non-static variables
6. priavte non-static variables
7. Constuctor
8. update & paint-methodes
9. Functions which are typicall for this class (except main function)
(10.main function)
11. getters and setters functions

In the future, before commiting we both have rewatch our code and see what could be made more efficient
And if we pull, we have to rewatch the code the other person wrote to see if we can improve the code
Lines marked with a # in front may be deleted - but no others. Mark them with #, if you want to get rid of them.

NEW QUESTIONS by SC 18.10-2013 03:53
#1) How should Seagulls shoot? a) just drop their Drop, b) aim at the player, c) drop the drop at a 45�� angle.
#DPX: You decide
#SC: a)

#2) How should Seagulls spawn? it doesn't make sense, to spawn them atop of walls, as they all fly out of the viewing field. 
#DPX: They should spawn randomly like "Test every 10 sec or something..."

3) Should Drop fall through walls as they do right now.. or not?
DPX:Maybe be platforms should get whiter and whiter? ;)
	BUT we have to change the mec, that the zombies get damage by seagulls
SC: So they should collide with the walls. (?) And the zombies already get damaged by Drop's. 
    (Not by Seagulls though.. would you like me to add this? 
     It would however not be clear, wheter Seagulls should hurt Zombies or Zombies should hurt Seagulls)

# 4) we have to introduce a new type of weapon, so that one can get rid of the seagulls.. or should they be kind of invulnerable?
# DPX: I would suggest invul except the ultra carp

5) Should the camera also follow a certain y-changement? I think that would add a nice effect. (Like xOffset, yOffset)
DPX: no it should, or you wouldnt see the next one down...
SC: HAHA. No it should.. Eeer.. ok.. (?)
    And you still would see the next one(what) down..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO SC:
 -implement physical jumping (with a parabolic jump courve or so XD)
 -correct the wall setting algorithm, as some walls are to high/low
 -all the variables that vary from level to level are static. they shouldn't be...
 -Seagull fly a bit more naturally
 -Projectiles should "kill" Items
 -implement own ideas
 
TODO DPX:
 -Reformat all classes to fit the new made rules above
 -Add Menu (if this is okay?) [Yes it is]
 -Add more support for more than one lvl
